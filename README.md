# QSP-UK 2025

The [marimo](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo) notebook [UQ.py](UQ.py) contains the code and slides from my [QSP-UK 2025](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/eng/research/grouplist/biomedicaleng/qsp-uk/) talk.

To run it, install marimo then instantiate a sandbox environment with the required dependencies:

```
pip install marimo
marimo run --sandbox UQ.py
```
